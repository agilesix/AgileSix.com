  Agile Six exists because of our belief in the power of technology to transform
  government and improve the lives of citizens. We’re the founders and charter
  members of the Digital Services Coalition, a collection of 16 design and
  technology firms that have redefined government digital services. We don’t
  just do the work, we help grow the market.
