## The Challenge

Like a lot of federal agencies, the Department of Veterans Affairs had
accumulated a mix of different, competing technologies and systems over the
years.

The lack of a single content management system (CMS) frustrated staff members, since they had inconsistent editorial workflows and a challenging publication process. And it also frustrated veterans, who struggled with the site’s confusing digital experience.

## The Solution

Through the US Digital Service at the VA, we’re consolidating all of VA.gov onto a single content management system (CMS) and introducing content governance rules and cross-site publishing capabilities. 

This will streamline the editorial process for VA editors across the country and help create a single, consistent voice for the VA online. 

By creating a standard content model and design system, we’re also helping VA.gov become a simpler, more intuitive experience — so it’s easier for veterans to access the services and support they deserve.
