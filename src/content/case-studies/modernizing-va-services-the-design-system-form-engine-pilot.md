The VA Design System Form Engine project, under VA’s CEDAR IDIQ and funded by the Technology Modernization Fund (TMF), addresses a longstanding challenge at the VA: digitizing forms. Traditionally, converting paper forms to digital formats required full engineering teams for each form. This pilot initiative aims to simplify the process by enabling non-technical staff to configure digital forms on their own. The solution enhances VA’s digital services, reduces costs, and saves time, all while improving Veterans’ access to the benefits they’ve earned. TMF funding has been crucial in bringing this pilot project to life, laying the groundwork for a scalable, sustainable solution.

Early progress in this pilot project is promising. The tool is making great strides in streamlining the form creation process, reducing reliance on costly engineering resources, and showing potential for significant efficiencies as it continues to evolve. Interest from multiple internal VA teams has highlighted its effectiveness in supporting a variety of forms, enabling departments to convert them to digital formats more efficiently. Additionally, the pilot has uncovered broader potential, with departments outside the initial scope expressing interest in using it. While still in its early stages, it has demonstrated the ability to empower non-technical staff and improve access to services for Veterans, offering a scalable solution that could address further needs across the VA.

Looking ahead, we are optimistic that the pilot project will continue refining the form creation process, driving long-term improvements in efficiency and cost savings. Continued TMF funding will be essential to fully realize this vision, refine the tool’s capabilities, and enable faster, more efficient services for Veterans, contributing to the ongoing modernization of the VA’s digital form creation process.
