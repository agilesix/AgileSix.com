**Redefining Mentor-Protégé Relationships: The agile six and theta. Partnership**

You don't often hear the words authenticity, intentionality, and collaboration used to describe mentor-protégé partnerships. President of agile six, Dan Levenson, and Founder and Managing Member of theta., Emmanuel (Mannie) Iroanya, discuss their unique mentor-protégé relationship, shared vision, values, and the importance of trusted relationships. They share how this partnership goes beyond contractual obligations and aims to reshape the landscape of mentor-protégé relationships by building something far greater.\
\
**The Beginning of a Trusted Partnership**

Let's start by exploring how your paths first crossed and what led to your collaboration over the years. Mannie, why don't you kick things off for us?

*Mannie:* Anita Allen connected us at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). She gave me a list of people to meet, and Dan was one of them. When I met him, I knew he was a cool dude. I pitched to him when he was in government and reached out again when he left. We've been friends ever since.

*Dan:* In 2017, most people I met were inauthentic, with a lot of business development (BD) speak. But Mannie and I hit it off immediately. After I joined agile six, he always supported us, even when others doubted. Our friendship, built on trust and authenticity, grew over the years. When I joined agile six, Robert (my partner and CEO) and I had ambitious ideas, believing government could be something different. As we gained success, there were many doubters, mostly anonymous on message boards. Mannie was the person who always had our back and put his name to it. We have wanted to work together for a long time, at least four or five years, but we knew we had to wait for the right timing when it would be mutually beneficial and sustainable. It all comes down to the trust and authenticity we have in knowing each other. I always believed we would work together at some point and would know when the time was right. This aligns with the sense-and-respond approach we take at agile six.\
\
**The Right Time for Collaboration**

**Why do you feel now is the right time for this collaboration?**

*Dan:* We've had time to know ourselves and our companies, to realize who we are and what we want to be. This isn’t just a relationship of convenience; it's intentional. As far as timing, agile six is at a point in our trajectory where we're large and stable enough to really look into the mentor-protégé program. We want to do it for the right reasons, in line with the true intent of the program, allowing for a partnership that is mutually beneficial from both a business and outcome standpoint.

We've always tried to provide support and mentorship to theta. and other companies we think are good for the space. Embracing this program allows us to take our partnership to the next level, committing to real mentorship and support for theta., helping them become the truest version of themselves. This partnership authorizes us to form a joint venture, allowing us to enter new markets together. 

We're not looking for theta. to become agile six, but to align our strengths and maximize value for both companies. We believe we can set a real example of what this program can look like.

*Mannie:* Honestly, it just feels right. We had to scrape our knees and figure out what we wanted in this space. It's easier to know what you like once you've experienced some things. We've experienced some things, and we know the space. We know some of the good people and how they operate, and some of the bad people and how they operate. I've never come to agile six or Dan asking for a handout. I stand on my own, and we both matured in the right way to take on a mentor-protégé relationship.

**Finding the Right Partner in Government Contracting**\
\
**How important is finding the right partner within the government contracting space, and how significant is the alignment of values in shaping these partnerships?**

*Mannie:* Our company is about intersectionality, meeting people where they are and helping them get where they want to be. We quickly realized that not everyone is about the greater good. We knew agile six was the right partner because our values align, and we want to deliver value for important programs. There are a lot more people who are just in it for themselves; agile six aligns with us in the way they view the world and the importance of delivering value.

*Dan:* Both companies have a strong sense of self, which is uncommon in this space. We push back against structures that don't work for people and trust in government. Being true to ourselves is essential. With Mannie and theta., we can be authentic. It’s crucial to find partners who understand the mission and purpose of the work we do. The alignment of values ensures that we can work together effectively and make a real impact.

**The Foundation of theta.**\
\
**In a previous conversation, you mentioned wanting to create a world where tech works for everybody. You also expressed gratitude for services like Medicare, saying without them, I wouldn't be here. Tell us more about how theta. came to be and how you got here.**

*Mannie:* Even before theta. itself, I knew I would do some type of consulting. But it wasn't until 2014, when I was working on a CMS project, that everything clicked. Sitting in my cubicle, I started to look around and realize all the intersectionality of the work I was doing and how it affected my real life. I saw how state benefits like Medicaid and the politics of healthcare were happening right in my backyard. This realization made me want to start a company focused on these important programs. During my time at ActionNet, I decided to start theta.

My journey is a story of the American dream. As an immigrant, programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) kept my family alive while my parents built their lives here. These programs literally kept us alive. I realized I was standing on the backs of thousands of lives and civil workers who supported us. So many people have done really important things to support us, even if I didn't know it. I am literally a product of some of the best parts of the government services that they provide.

**Shared Values and Vision**

**How have shared values influenced your partnership?**

*Dan:* We both believe government is here to help people. We view our role as harm reduction and being good fiduciaries of taxpayer money. It's about being real partners to government, having hard conversations, and pushing back when necessary. We see our work as part of a larger mission to improve government services.

*Mannie:* Our values at theta. are service, passion, and being different. We align with agile six because they share similar values and authenticity. We're not afraid to be different and take a unique approach to solve problems. This alignment allows us to work together seamlessly and effectively.

**Unique Aspects of the theta six Partnership**

**What makes [theta six](https://www.thetasix.com/) different from other mentor-protégé partnerships?**

*Dan:* Many companies take a predatory approach, but we see theta.'s strength as agile six's strength and vice versa. We believe in long-term relationships, not transactional ones. We're proud to share our ideas and approaches with like-minded companies. We don’t view this partnership as a transaction, but as a long-term relationship that benefits both of us and sets a positive example for others.

*Mannie:* agile six lives what they say. They got my back. The culture and authenticity haven't changed; they've just matured. We trust each other and believe in doing incredible work together. We’re not just partners in business, but in our values and vision for what government services can be.

**Our Goals for the Mentor-Protégé Program**

**What do you aim to achieve through this Mentor-Protégé Program?**

*Mannie:* One thing Dan and I have discussed with this Mentor-Protégé Program is helping theta. mature into the company we know we can be. As Dan said, a lot of the tools are already there. We've been like a little hurricane, just spinning, trying to gain some momentum here, and being able to unlock that momentum, that energy for good and positivity, and actual sustainability and growth are things that we're really excited about doing under this Mentor-Protégé Program. We’ve won small things in the past, but it's about building that capacity to really affect the change we want. This is a big part of why we're in it together.

*Dan:* While we are formally the mentors to this program, any mentorship worth its salt is bi-directional in nature. We're excited to learn a lot from theta. and all of their experiences and everything that they have to offer. I think we've also talked a lot about the ability to do more good work together and the potential through the 8(a) program to strengthen the relationship that we have with governments, given that it allows for sole-source conversations and even negotiations to spin up a contract. It just could bring us even closer to government to share ideas and approaches and proof of concepts and try some things that can really move the needle to help people. This partnership allows us to enter new markets together, aligning our strengths and making a bigger impact.

**Impact on the Industry and Future Mentor-Protégé Programs**\
\
**How do you think agile six and theta. will influence views on mentor-protégé programs in the industry?**

*Mannie:* We hope to show that this program, done in the spirit of doing it right, can build protégé companies to the capacity where they can each-one-teach-one, become mentors in their own rights to others, and be sustainable companies that thrive without their mentor.

*Dan:* Mentor-protégé relationships can be built on long-term and meaningful interactions, not just transactional ones. We've known each other for many years, and I expect to still know Mannie and theta. after the mentor-protégé program ends in six years. This is just one season of our broader relationship, which I think is pretty uncommon in this space of just having that intentionality. Our goal is to demonstrate that authentic, value-driven partnerships can lead to significant sustainable growth.

**Advice for Companies Seeking Similar Partnerships**

**What advice would you give to companies considering similar partnerships?**

*Mannie:* Take your time to find the right people. Treat it like a real relationship. Vet it, make sure it's real and authentic, and ensure you're aligned. It’s not just about finding a partner; it’s about finding the right partner who shares your values and vision.

*Dan:* Be honest about the trade-offs. If a transactional approach with a lot of financial upside is right for you, that's a choice you can make. But as Mannie said, take the time to skin your knees and understand yourself. Know what the right path forward is for you. This path might not be right for everyone, but we aim to prove that a relationship-based approach can work. Make sure there’s someone high enough in the company to make decisions and have real conversations when challenges arise. It’s crucial to have tight feedback loops and ensure alignment at all levels, from values to business goals. Can you pick up the phone and call someone and have that real conversation? That’s always been critical when thinking about partnering.

**Final Thoughts**

*Dan:* I'm just grateful to have this partnership to be able to work with people who I trust and I really care about and to just keep moving forward and challenging the status quo. Just because everybody else has been doing something doesn't mean that we can't try a different approach. theta six is going to be ourselves, and that's not agile six, that's not theta. That's going to be something unique and different. Everyone else is taken.

*Mannie:* One of my favorite rappers, Jay-Z, said, “The genius thing we did was that we didn't give up.” And we never have given up on this dream of being the best versions of ourselves and what we believe theta. can be. We've stayed low, we've kept firing. And so to have partners like agile six that are going to have our back, that are going to have our six as we continue to keep participating in this marathon – theta six will be the best example of how a mentor-protégé program can work.
