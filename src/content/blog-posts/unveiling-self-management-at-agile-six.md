Do you think working in a fully remote, self-managed environment means you're on your own? Think again. In the dynamic landscape of remote workplaces, self-management has emerged as a foundational element for fostering collaboration, autonomy, and innovation. At Agile Six, self-management isn't merely a concept; it's a core value that shapes our culture and drives our success.

Agile Six operates without traditional middle managers. Instead, we have a less hierarchical structure that amplifies trust, autonomy, and collective contribution. This approach accelerates decision-making by giving agency to the team members closest to the problem and encourages a culture where every team member has a significant role in shaping our success.

In this article, we'll explore the essence of self-management, debunk common misconceptions, and illustrate how it supports our organization through the perspectives of our employees.

## Understanding Self-Management: It's This, Not That

At Agile Six, self-management is the cornerstone of our fully remote culture, embodying more than mere autonomy. It weaves responsibility, adaptability, and proactive collaboration into the fabric of our daily work. Dotti Cummings, an Enterprise Agile Coach at Agile Six, captures this essence perfectly: “Self-management is about fitting yourself into the team like a puzzle piece, finding how best you can contribute.” This principle guides us towards collective strength, where individual goals align with our shared mission. \

At Agile Six, self-management means:

\- Holding oneself accountable for agreed-upon tasks and responsibilities, not waiting to be told what to do or relying solely on others for direction. 

\- Being proactive in seeking feedback and advice to improve, not assuming you should inherently know how to manage every aspect of your work without input.

\- Understanding and adapting to what the team needs, not doing whatever you want without consideration for the team's goals.

\- Contributing to and integrating with the team's dynamics, not working in isolation or prioritizing individual goals over the team's objectives.

\- Making informed decisions and taking responsibility within the team's framework, not making unilateral decisions or acting without consulting or considering the team's strategy, needs, guardrails, and team agreements.

\- Asking for and providing support within the team, not struggling silently or believing that seeking help shows weakness.

In our remote workspace, self-management flourishes through active listening, autonomy, and the flexibility to adapt roles and tasks as our projects evolve. We operate within a framework of mutual support and agreed-upon objectives. Our approach to self-management emphasizes encouraging each team member to leverage their unique strengths towards our common goals. This fosters a culture of innovation where asking for and offering help is seen as a strength, ensuring no one faces challenges alone.

Through this lens, we prioritize empowerment, collaboration, and flexibility, enabling us to embrace the dynamic nature of remote work with confidence and creativity. Self-management at Agile Six isn't just about how we work; it's about how we succeed together, transforming challenges into opportunities for growth and successful outcomes.\

You'll clearly see after reading this article, self-management isn't about the self.

## Perspectives from the Sixers: Insights on Self-Management. 

"While self-management promotes autonomy, it doesn't equate to unrestrained freedom. Instead, it's about making informed decisions that contribute to the team's and organization's objectives, respecting the shared vision and expertise within the group.

In environments that promote self-management, such as agile work settings, the role of coaching and feedback is not to dictate actions but to provide insights and advice that help individuals and teams navigate their tasks more effectively." ~ Josh Quagliaroli, Chief Delivery Officer

"Self-management is about balancing autonomy and accountability. With great power comes great responsibility." ~ Guy Schmidt, UX Designer/Researcher

### \-﻿-----﻿----

"Transitioning to self-management was very positive as it taught me how to be more self-organized and self-managed professionally and within my own personal life." ~ Athena Bozak, UX Researcher

### \-﻿-----﻿----

"Self-management is about taking ownership of your work and seeking more responsibilities while asking for help when needed." ~ Matt Kerns, Software Engineer

### \-﻿-----﻿----

"Self-management isn't about the self here; it's all built into the context of the team's success." ~ Jill Adams, Delivery Manager

### \-﻿---------

"I love asking people on my team for feedback. I still find a way to get that feedback cycle. You don't need a manager to tell you, 'Hey, you're doing good,' or 'You need improvement over here.' Ask the people you work with, just use your sprint retros. There are places for those things without a management layer in a way that's more applicable and effective for your day-to-day.\
\
The self-management layer coupled with trust is our 'secret sauce.' It's fulfilling to work in a place that values me and contributes to the betterment of society." ~ Tanner Heffner, Software Engineer

## Navigating Workplace Dynamics:

**Insights from Sara Quagliaroli, Agile Six’s Self-Management Coach**

> "We're humans doing human stuff. It's not just about ticking boxes or making decisions; it's about the connections we forge and the support we offer each other. When conflict arises or someone needs guidance, it's rarely about the technical aspects of their work. It's about the human interactions, the misunderstandings, the need for validation and understanding.
>
> People come to me because they're struggling with the human side of work. They want to improve their relationships, communicate better, and build stronger connections within the team. It's not about whether they're doing their job well in a technical sense; it's about how they're navigating the complexities of working with other people."

## **Successful Self-Management Practices and What They Look Like**

Wondering what successful self-management practices look like at Agile Six? We talked with Delivery Manager Sarah Knopp to get her insights.\
\
**Asking for Advice**

Don’t make decisions in isolation. Sarah stresses the importance of seeking guidance from peers and teammates to prevent such situations, ensuring alignment with team objectives and fostering cohesive team dynamics.

**Assessing the Value and Urgency of Work**

Evaluate your tasks to discern what genuinely requires attention. Sarah draws from her own experience, mentioning spending excessive time on low-priority tasks like adjusting PowerPoint details, which she acknowledges as inefficient and unproductive. Instead, she suggests focusing on high-value and high-urgency tasks to maximize productivity and avoid unnecessary stress.

**Collaboration**

Seek input and assistance; don’t wait for others to initiate. Sarah shares that the most effective teams actively seek collaboration and feedback, which accelerates the work process and brings diverse insights.

**Self-Care**

Prioritize self-care. Sarah ties it back to the company's just cause of putting people first. She emphasizes how individual well-being directly affects team productivity, saying, "Taking care of myself is taking care of my team." Self-care not only improves team dynamics, but also creates a positive work environment that supports productivity and well-being.

**Using Agile and Scrum Methodologies**

Use Agile frameworks and Scrum practices in managing workloads, especially when the volume of tasks is high. Sarah shares that these methodologies help organize and prioritize tasks more effectively, contrasting with the stress and inefficiency of less structured approaches.
