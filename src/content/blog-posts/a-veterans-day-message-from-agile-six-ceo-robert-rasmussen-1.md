Ten years ago, my partners and I decided to launch a business. One of our first decisions was critical to our success: Who would we serve? It has been the pleasure of my life these past ten years to focus on Veterans, particularly the veteran-facing services of the Department of Veterans Affairs.  

It was a challenging feat to break into this sacred market and gain the trust of our clients at the VA. But I suspect our key was an alignment in our values, namely our commitment to putting people first. The first time I visited the VA headquarters in DC, I read the words on the plaque at eye level on the building – "To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow, and his orphan." These words, our 16th president Lincoln’s famous charge, are the adopted motto of the Department of Veterans Affairs. 

President Lincoln's words have stood the test of time and stand today as a solemn reminder of the VA's commitment to caring for and putting first those injured in our nation's defense and the families of those killed in its service. But as we have evolved, the VA has updated its motto to reflect a growing consciousness of the diversity of our Veteran community, both those who served and those who support them.  On March 16, 2023, the VA announced an updated version of its 1959 mission statement: "To fulfill President Lincoln's promise to care for those who have served in our nation's military and for their families, caregivers, and survivors."

This adaptation recognizes that Veterans are not a monolith; we are nearly as diverse as the population we serve. We are women and men, binary and non-binary, LGBTQ+, Democrats, Republicans, Independents, and immigrants of all kinds. We are young and old, mothers and fathers, teachers, doctors, entrepreneurs, and, unfortunately, sometimes unemployed or unwanted. We are healthy and unhealthy, abled and disabled, housed and unhoused. The challenges of “those who have served” span the spectrum of humanity. 

This adaptation also recognizes that our supporters at home are not limited to “his widow, and his orphan,” but rather are as diverse as Veterans themselves. On my last deployment, my command awarded unofficial medals to all the partners and spouses. The medal, proudly displayed in my shadow box, boldly states: "They who wait also serve." Waiting is immensely lonely, and managing the homefront brings demands and dangers sometimes greater than those faced in uniform. Those brave and selfless people deserve our unending gratitude. 

So, let us thank the partners, children, parents, childcare providers, neighbors, friends, and family who stand beside our service memebers. Even in peacetime, about 200,000 families are experiencing separation. This holiday season (and every day), please check in on these supporting heroes and recognize their sacrifice.
