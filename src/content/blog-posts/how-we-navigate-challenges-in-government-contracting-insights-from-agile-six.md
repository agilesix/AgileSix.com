In the realm of government contracting, where uncertainty is the norm and challenges abound, the journey can be as trying as it is rewarding. At Agile Six, our people-first approach, values-driven culture, and pursuit of purposeful work are instrumental in navigating the ever-shifting landscape of civic tech. I had the opportunity to speak with Dan Levenson, President of Agile Six, and Software Engineer Tanner Heffner. From those conversations, I gained valuable insights into their experiences and perspectives that have shaped the story shared in this article.

As I revisited the conversations with Tanner and Dan, I realized there's another narrative to be told — one that brings together the perspectives of both a Sixer (employee) and the company's leadership. Tanner's journey, in particular, struck a chord with me. During our discussion news broke that Agile Six had lost a recompete bid on the project Tanner was working on. In the shadow of this news, Tanner candidly shared his own past experience facing this exact challenge, which had led him to depart Agile Six previously. Tanner's recounting of his journey sparked a curiosity within me. Here was someone who had navigated the challenging landscape of government contracting, faced uncertainties, and yet chose to return. Why? This moment generated the story I sought to tell. Tanner's personal experiences and emotions, from his departure from Agile Six to his eventual return, shed light on the resilience and determination that are embedded in the company's culture.\

In our conversation, Tanner emphasized that the self-management layer, closely coupled with trust, sets Agile Six apart, describing these two elements together as the 'secret sauce.' Reflecting on his experience, Tanner stated, "...there are a lot of other companies that do not have self-management. It's not that I dislike hierarchy, but if I have the option, I prefer to go to a place that trusts you to do your work rather than do your work but report to x, y, z, fill out your quarterly goals, and do all this stuff. I'm going to take the self-management approach every time. It's far more appealing to me. That's a huge thing."

Dan Levenson, President of Agile Six, echoed Tanner's sentiments, emphasizing the company's unwavering commitment to its core values of trust, self-management, and inclusion. He provided profound insights into Agile Six's approach: "I believe our values and the culture that stems from those values are the foundation of how we approach challenging times. Trust is key; because we have trust, we're able to approach teams and people affected, as well as others within the company, in a transparent way and with openness, not trying to hide the realities of the space in which we're operating—the good, the bad, and everything in between."

Dan continued, "Our commitment to purposeful work is crucial. We're really open with folks that what we're not willing to do is just go and say any revenue's good revenue and find work that doesn't align with our values just to potentially fill a short-term need. That doesn't mean we're not committed to finding as many great options as possible for folks who are impacted and keeping the company as resilient as possible. But we're very clear that our values are there for a reason, and they're going to guide how we respond to any type of situation, especially challenging situations like a contract loss."

These insights underscore the broader impact of Agile Six's projects in the civic tech space and the critical role that self-management and trust play in fostering collaboration and innovation within the organization. By prioritizing people first, values, and purposeful work, Agile Six remains steadfast in its commitment to driving positive change in the civic tech space.

Since the interviews with Dan and Tanner were conducted and published, Tanner has decided to remain with Agile Six and transition to a new project. This decision underscores Tanner's commitment to purpose-driven work and Agile Six’s self-management culture. It also highlights the company's resilience in navigating the ever-changing landscape of government contracting by putting people first.
