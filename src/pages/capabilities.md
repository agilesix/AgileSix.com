  Agile Six is a full-spectrum digital services company that combines digital
  government modernization, product delivery, and human-centered design. 


  But we’re not just a tech company. We’re a solutions company. While most of
  our work is digital, we recognize that some problems can’t be solved by coding
  or new hardware. Our team will work with you to figure out what you need —
  sometimes the best solution is as low-tech as a new process for handling
  incoming paperwork. 


  ### Core Competency Areas
capabilities:
  - Devops & Cloud
  - Human Centered Design
  - Market Development
  - Digital Transformation
process-title: How we work
process-body: >-
  Our seasoned team of agile practitioners brings expertise across the entire
  acquisition and delivery lifecycle, from budgets and procurement to research,
  design, and development. We uncover problems and iterate on solutions quickly,
  so we learn fast and live by incremental improvement. 


  We’re certified practitioners, trainers, and coaches in a number of Agile
  frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, and SAFe. More importantly, we truly
  understand the fundamental principles behind these frameworks, so we can
  tailor our agile approach based on an organization’s or team’s current level
  of know-how and adoption. That’s the best way to ensure that digital
  transformation will stick — and that Agile becomes institutionalized at
  multiple levels of your organization.
