intro: >
  People depend on government digital services to stay healthy, pay the rent,
  and protect their families. But those services are often frustrating and hard
  to use. Agency employees do their best to help, but they may be fighting the
  constraints of legacy systems and years of ad hoc fixes. 


  Agile Six was founded to help fix this problem, one agency at a time.

history-title: How we got here
history-body: >-
  In 2014, Robert Rasmussen was working as an IT contractor after having worked
  for a decade in the telecom sector — and before that as a network and systems
  engineer in the U.S. Navy. Ernie Ramirez worked as a partner in a game studio
  and then as a leader at Amazon Game Studios. Both were looking for something
  new, a way to use their expertise to create something more meaningful.


  Then they got their inspiration. The newly formed [U.S. Digital Service released its Playbook](https://playbook.cio.gov/), which outlined 13 key plays to help governments build more successful digital services. For Robert and Ernie, that playbook was the catalyst. Within the year, they founded Agile Six — a company dedicated to helping government put those 13 plays into practice.


  Our team hit some roadblocks along the way, and the biggest was recognizing that federal ecosystems just weren’t ready for digital transformation at scale. But we didn’t give up. We did what agile people do — pivoted and adapted our approach. By adding coaching to our services, we were able to help staff prepare for the changes we could create.


  Since our founding, Agile Six has helped build the civic tech marketplace and grew in size to over 90 employees. We’re now the full-spectrum digital service company we envisioned at our founding, working side-by-side with our civil servant partners to build the better government we all deserve.
