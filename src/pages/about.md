  We think that government technology needs to make day-to-day life for citizens
  easier.

  After all, a person’s finances, health, and well-being can depend on their
  ability to understand and use an agency’s digital services. But too often,
  those services leaves users confused and pounding their keyboards in
  frustration. 




  We understand why, too. Agencies can get stuck with systems that private
  industry left behind long ago. Employees do their best, but they’re often
  fighting the constraints of legacy systems and years of ad hoc fixes. 




  It doesn’t have to be this way.

purpose-body: >-
  **Progress, not disruption**


  We won’t come in to “save” you, blow up your current system, and then leave
  you stranded with some off-the-shelf software. That’s malpractice, as far as
  we’re concerned. Instead, we’ll listen to your needs and customize a solution
  that staff and stakeholders can support and use. 




  **Changing systems, changing minds**


  Adopting a new workflow isn’t as easy as swapping in new software — it’s a
  process. So we’re more than just developers, we’re guides and teachers. We
  lead staff trainings to answer questions and build confidence. When we’re done
  with your project, you’ll be ready to take the reins.




  **Simplicity**


  Sure, some projects do require an ingenious outside-the-box solution (we’ve
  come up with plenty). But if a simple fix does the job, we’ll choose it every
  time. Why spend time and money on complexity you don’t need?




  **True agility**


  Lots of companies “do Agile” — they use the lingo, perform the ceremonies,
  follow the process. But that’s just the start. Agile isn’t really a system you
  impose. It’s more about awareness, listening, and being ready to respond to
  change. So we don’t just do Agile. We are agile. 




  **Work that matters**


  We’re dedicated to purpose over profit. We’ve turned down big contracts
  because we didn’t believe in the work, or because we would have been forced us
  to turn into a giant, impersonal company we never want to be. Staying small
  and choosy keeps us agile — and able to do meaningfulthe work we care about.
history-title: How we got here
history-body: >-
  In 2014, Robert Rasmussen was working as an IT contractor after having worked
  for a decade in the telecom sector — and before that as a network and systems
  engineer in the U.S. Navy. Ernie Ramirez worked as a partner in a game studio
  and then as a leader at Amazon Game Studios. Both were looking for something
  new, a way to use their expertise to create something more meaningful.




  Then they got their inspiration. The newly formed (U.S. Digital Service
  released its Playbook)[https://playbook.cio.gov/], which outlined 13 key plays
  to help governments build more successful digital services. For Robert and
  Ernie, that playbook was the catalyst. Within the year, they founded Agile Six
  — a company dedicated to helping government put those 13 plays into practice.




  Our team hit some roadblocks along the way, and the biggest was recognizing
  that federal ecosystems just weren’t ready for digital transformation at
  scale. But we didn’t give up. We did what agile people do — pivoted and
  adapted our approach. By adding coaching to our services, we were able to help
  staff prepare for the changes we could create.




  Since our founding, Agile Six has helped build the civic tech marketplace and
  quadrupled in size to over 30 employees. We’re now the full-spectrum digital
  service company we envisioned at our founding, working side-by-side with our
  civil servant partners to build the better government we all deserve.
