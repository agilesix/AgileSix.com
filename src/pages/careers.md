  The relationship between employer and employee or government and industry is
  often antagonistic and viewed as zero-sum. For an employee or vendor to win,
  the company or government must lose, which results in poor outcomes for
  people’s health and wellbeing, taxpayers, system users and government
  employees. 


  We grew tired of being sold these false choices of what it takes to “get ahead,” which often includes climbing a never ending ladder or being forced to make impossible tradeoffs between family, health, and a career. Choices forced upon us in service to the remorseless quest for endless profits and growth.

  At Agile Six, we’re about purpose over profit. We believe in our people—that
  they are most capable of self-managing and making decisions within their daily
  lives.  


  We’re committed to our employees by building in these non-negotiables:


  **Purposeful work**


  We only support a project if we’re all-in. This has led us to support missions like Pandemic Readiness at the CDC, improving veteran-facing services at the VA, and modernizing the medicare payment systems at CMS.


  **Part of the solution**


  We’ll never sell out for a quick profit, and have built our company based on relationships and organic growth rather than a predatory capture mindset that’s the status quo for most of the industry. 


  **Putting wholeness and wellbeing first**


  Working or answering emails on vacation, late at night, or on the weekends shouldn’t be glorified. 


  **No middle management**


  We provide coaching, training, professional and personal development, and other support to teams. We empower our employees to make decisions at a level where the information resides. 


  **Incentivize behaviors that align with our Just Cause and integrity**


  We refuse to perpetuate a broken system and participate in the ethical fading that comes with justifying this behavior.
