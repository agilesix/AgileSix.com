  At Agile Six, we’re about purpose over profit. We believe in our people—that
  they are most capable of self-managing and making decisions within their daily
  lives.  


  **We’ve always believed you can put humans and integrity first, and you can also have a thriving business.**

  We’re committed to our employees by building in these non-negotiables:


  **Purposeful work**


  We only support a project if we’re all-in. This has led us to support missions like pandemic readiness at the CDC, improving veteran-facing services at the VA, and modernizing the Medicare payment systems at CMS.


  **Part of the solution**


  We’ll never sell out for a quick profit, and have built our company based on relationships and organic growth rather than a predatory capture mindset that’s the status quo for most of the industry. 


  **Putting wholeness and wellbeing first**


  We don't glorify working or answering emails on vacation, late at night, or on the weekends. We trust you to make decisions that help you do your job, be fulfilled and whole.


  **No middle management**


  We provide coaching, training, professional and personal development, and other support to teams. We empower our employees to make decisions at a level where the information resides. 


  **Incentivize behaviors that align with our Just Cause and integrity**


  We intentionally build structures that incentivize behaviors aligning with our Just Cause and integrity. For us to win, the Government, users and taxpayers must also win.
