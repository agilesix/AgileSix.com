  Agile Six has offices in San Diego, CA, Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD, but
  most of our staff is remote. That allows our employees a better work-life
  balance, and offers us the best talent from across the country.


  Why work with us? Because you’ll:


  **Do meaningful work**


  We’re deliberate about every project we take on. If we’re not passionate about
  it or it doesn’t align with our values, we won’t do it.


  **Be part of something big**


  Agile Six is an important player in the larger civic tech community. We’re
  united by a belief in helping government serve citizens better. 


  **Get the freedom to do your thing**


  People do their best work when they’re challenged with projects that matter
  and given the ownership to find the solution. 


  **Teach us something new**


  We hire from across different sectors of the industry because fresh
  perspectives make our work better. Every one of us, from our newest hire to
  our founders, is both a student and a teacher. 


  **Create the job you want**


  For a start, we offer flexible schedules, paid personal time off, profit
  sharing, and financial help with career development and certifications.
