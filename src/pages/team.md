  At Agile Six, we work as a team. We trust and help each other. And we
  consciously pull talent from all sorts of different sectors because we want to
  learn from them — and because different perspectives on a project will make
  for a better end result.


  Staff hierarchy is overrated. Every one of usthose faces below, from our
  founders to our most recent hires, areis both a teachers and studentsand a
  students.

  **What we do matters.**

  We’re deliberate about the projects we take on. If the work doesn’t align with
  our mission, we won’t do it.


  **We’re passionate.**

  We’re a close-knit group bound together by a belief in our mission to help
  government better serve citizens.


  **We let you do your thing.**

  People do their best work when they’re challenged with projects that matter
  and given the ownership to find the solution. 


  **We’re not in it to boost our egos.**

  On our projects, we don’t single out individuals as heroes or rockstars. We
  celebrate our successes together.

That’s a military term for “we’ve got your back.” And it’s been a guiding principle for us since we started.
