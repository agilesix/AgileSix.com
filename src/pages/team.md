  “We’ve got your six” has been a guiding principle for our team members since
  the start. Our founder Robert Rasmussen picked it up during his service in the
  U.S. Navy, and it’s reflected right there in our name.


  At Agile Six, we take the one-team approach seriously. No strict hierarchies, no jockeying for status. We’re equally dedicated to the work and to each other.
