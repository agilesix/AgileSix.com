  That’s a military term for “we’ve got your back.” 


  “We’ve got your six” has been a guiding principle for our team members since
  the start. Our founder Robert Rasmussen picked it up during his service in the
  U.S. Navy, and it’s reflected right there in our name.


  At Agile Six, we take the one-team approach seriously. No strict hierarchies,
  no jockeying for status. We’re equally dedicated to the work and to each
  other.

  Agile Six has offices in San Diego, CA and Baltimore, MD, but most of our
  staff is remote. That allows our employees a better work-life balance, and
  offers us the best talent from across the country.


  Why work with us? Because you’ll:


  **Do meaningful work**


  We’re deliberate about every project we take on. If we’re not passionate about
  it or it doesn’t align with our values, we won’t do it.


  **Be part of something big**


  Agile Six is an important player in the larger civic tech community. We’re
  united by a belief in helping government serve citizens better. 


  **Get the freedom to do your thing**


  People do their best work when they’re challenged with projects that matter
  and given the ownership to find the solution.
